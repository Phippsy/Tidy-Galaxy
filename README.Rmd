## Repository Contents

- README.md: this file
- run_analysis.R: an R script to extract target data and output a tidy data set (see below for more information)
- "output/fullData.csv" and "output/tidyData.csv": the two files produced by run_analysis.R. 
	- fullData.csv has 10,299 observations of 68 variables.
	- tidyData.csv has 2,640 observations of 4 variables.
- CodeBook.md: the codebook for the tidy and full data sets produced.

## Introduction
The files in this repository were produced to extract a subset of data from an experiment to measure sensor signals from a Galaxy Smartphone. Further details on this experiment can be found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Source data can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This script requires the plyr, dplyr and reshape libraries. To install these in R, type the following command into your console:

```r
install.packages( c("plyr","dplyr","reshape2") )
```

There aren't many git commits in this repository because I initially made the mistake of including the ~200Mb source data in my push to github, so had to start a new folder without it. D'oh!

## Output files
- The fullData.csv file provides measurements on only the mean and standard deviation for all subjects and all activities. 
- The tidyData.csv file shows the aggregated mean of each measurement in a tall and skinny format.

## run_analysis.R
This script performs the following steps:

*Part 1*
1. Loads in the original data set
2. Reads in the test and training data sets, combines each with their respective subject IDs and activity descriptions.
3. Combines the test and training data sets.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean or standard deviation.
5. Labels variables with descriptive variable names.
	
*Part 2*
1. For each subject, by activity, provides the average of each measurement which was selected in part 1.
